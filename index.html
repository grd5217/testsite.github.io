			<h2>General info:</h2>
		</header>
		
		<p>
			The largemouth bass (*Micropterus salmoides*) is one of North America's most iconic freshwater fish, prized by anglers for its aggressive strikes and powerful fights. Native to the eastern and central United States, this species has become a staple of sport fishing, widely stocked in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs around the world. Recognized by its broad, elongated body, olive-green coloration, and large mouth that extends past the eye, the largemouth bass thrives in warm, slow-moving waters with plenty of vegetation. Beyond its sporting appeal, the largemouth bass plays a key role in aquatic ecosystems as a top predator, influencing the populations of other fish and invertebrates. Its adaptability and popularity make it a central figure in freshwater fishing culture and conservation efforts.

			<h2>Habitat</h2>
		</header>
		
		
		<section>	<!--lakes and ponds subsection-->
			<h3>Lakes and Ponds:</h3>
			
			<ul>	<!-- lakes and ponds list-->
				<li>Shallow, weedy areas are prime spots, offering both food and shelter.</li>
				<li>Bass often stay near submerged logs, rocks, stumps, and vegetation like lily pads or hydrilla.</li>
				<li>In deeper lakes, they may retreat to cooler, deeper water during hot summer months.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		
		<section>	<!--Rivers/streams subsection-->
				<h3>Rivers and Streams:</h3>
			
				<ul>	<!-- rivers/streams list-->
					<li>Found in slow-moving stretches, backwaters, and oxbows with minimal current.</li>
					<li>They favor areas with overhanging banks, fallen trees, or root systems for cover.</li>
				</ul>
		</section>
		
		
		<section>	<!--reservoirs subsection-->
				<h3>Reserviors:</h3>
			
				<ul>	<!--reservoirs list-->
					<li>Largemouth bass thrive in man-made reservoirs, especially where creek arms, coves, and submerged structures exist.</li>
					<li>Fluctuating water levels can affect their behavior, often pushing them into protected, shallow bays during spawning.</li>
				</ul>
		</section>

		<section>	<!-- temp/water qual. subsection-->
				<h3>Temperature and Water Quality:</h3>
			
				<ul>	<!--temop/water qual. list-->
					<li>Optimal water temperatures range from 65°F to 85°F (18°C to 29°C).</li>
					<li>They prefer moderately clear to slightly murky water, avoiding extremely turbid or polluted conditions</li>
					<li>Adequate dissolved oxygen levels and a healthy prey population (like minnows, sunfish, or crayfish) are crucial for survival.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Identification</h2>
		</header>
		
		<p>Identifying a largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is relatively easy thanks to several distinctive features. Here’s how to recognize one:</p>
		

		<section>	<!--mouth subsection-->
			<h3>Mouth:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The mouth is very large, with the upper jaw extending past the rear edge of the eye when closed—this is the most defining feature.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		
		<section>	<!--body shape/size subsection-->
			<h3>Body Shape and Size:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The body is elongated and robust, with a slightly compressed (flattened) shape from side to side.</li>
				<li>Adults typically range from 12 to 20 inches (30–50 cm) long but can grow much larger, with trophy bass exceeding 10 pounds (4.5 kg).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		
		<section>	<!--coloration subsection-->
			<h3>Coloration:</h3>
			
			<ul>
					<li>The body is usually greenish to olive on the back, fading to a whitish or pale yellow belly.</li>
					<li>A distinct dark, horizontal stripe runs along each side of the body, from the gills to the tail.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		
		<section>	<!--fins subsection-->
			<h3>Fins:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>It has two dorsal fins: the front dorsal fin is spiny, and the rear dorsal fin is soft-rayed, but they are connected by a shallow notch.</li>
				<li>The tail fin is slightly forked or rounded.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		
		<section>	<!--scales/texture subsection-->
			<h3>Scales and Texture:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Covered with small, rough scales (ctenoid scales).</li>
				<li>The skin feels somewhat rough if rubbed from tail to head.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
			
			
		<section>
			<h3>Eye color:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Typically dark or reddish-brown, especially in older or more aggressive individuals.</li>
				</ul>
		</section>
		
		
		<section>	<!--comparison tip subsection-->
				<h3>Comparison Tip:</h3>
				<p>Don’t confuse it with the smallmouth bass or spotted bass:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Smallmouth bass have a smaller mouth (jaw doesn't reach past the eye) and a more bronze color.</li>
					<li>Spotted bass have smaller mouths too, and their side markings are more blotchy than solid.</li>
				</ul>

	<!--Sport fishing section-->
	<header>Sport Bass Fishing:</header>
	<ul>
		<section>Sport bass fishing, especially targeting the 	largemouth bass, is one of the most popular forms of recreational angling in North America. It’s more than just catching fish—it's a highly competitive, skill-driven activity that blends strategy, patience, and passion.</section>
	
		<header>Why It's Popular:</header>
		<ul>
			<section>Aggressive strikes: Largemouth bass are known for their hard hits and acrobatic fights.</section>
			
			<section>Widespread availability: Found in lakes, ponds, rivers, and reservoirs across much of the U.S. and beyond.</section>
			
			<section>Catch-and-release culture: Many anglers release bass to preserve populations and support sustainable fishing.</section>
		</ul>
		
		<header>Techniques and Tactics:</header>
		<ul>
			<section>Sport bass fishing involves a variety of techniques, each tailored to specific conditions:</section>
			<ul>
				<header>Lure Fishing:</header>
				<ul>
					<section>Crankbaits: Mimic baitfish; used for covering water quickly.</section>
					
					<section>Soft plastics: Like worms or creature baits; great for slow, subtle presentations.</section>
					
					<section>Spinnerbaits: Flashy and noisy; effective in murky water.</section>
					
					<section>Topwater lures: Create surface action; thrilling visual strikes.</section>
				</ul>
				
				<header>Fly Fishing:</header>
				<ul>
					<section>Less common but growing in popularity. Fly anglers use streamers and poppers to mimic frogs, baitfish, or insects.</section>
				</ul>
				
				<header>Live Bait Fishing:</header>
				<ul>
					<section>Minnows, nightcrawlers, or shiners are used, especially by beginners or in colder months.</section>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<header>When To Fish:</header>
		<ul>
			<section>Spring (Spawning Season): Bass move to shallow waters and become very active—prime time for fishing.</section>
			
			<section>Summer: Early morning and evening are best as bass retreat to deeper, cooler areas during midday.</section>
			
			<section>Fall: Another strong season as bass feed heavily to prepare for winter.</section>
			
			<section>Winter: Slower action; bass are less active but still catchable with finesse techniques.</section>
		</ul>
		
		<header>Tournaments and Competitions:</header>
		<ul>
			<section>Bassmaster, Major League Fishing (MLF), and FLW are top professional tournament circuits.</section>
			
			<section>Anglers compete by catching the heaviest limit (usually 5 fish) within a set time.</section>
			
			<section>Tournaments often follow strict catch-and-release rules, with fish weighed live and returned to the water.</section>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<!--culture/community section-->
	<header>Culture and Community:</header>
	<ul>
		<section>Bass fishing has a strong community aspect: clubs, local events, and youth leagues.</section>
		
		<section>Many anglers invest in specialized gear—bass boats, fish finders, and high-performance tackle.</section>
		
		<section>Conservation is a major theme, with many groups promoting habitat protection, invasive species control, and ethical angling.</section>
