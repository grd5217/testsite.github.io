    <!-- General Info -->
    <section>
      <h2>General Info</h2>
      <p>The largemouth bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) is one of North America's most iconic freshwater fish, prized by anglers for its aggressive strikes and powerful fights. Native to the eastern and central United States, this species has become a staple of sport fishing, widely stocked in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs around the world.</p>
      <p>Recognized by its broad, elongated body, olive-green coloration, and large mouth that extends past the eye, the largemouth bass thrives in warm, slow-moving waters with plenty of vegetation. Beyond its sporting appeal, the largemouth bass plays a key role in aquatic ecosystems as a top predator, influencing the populations of other fish and invertebrates.</p>

    <!-- Habitat -->
    <section>
      <h2>Habitat</h2>

      <h3>Lakes and Ponds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Shallow, weedy areas are prime spots, offering both food and shelter.</li>
        <li>Bass often stay near submerged logs, rocks, stumps, and vegetation like lily pads or hydrilla.</li>
        <li>In deeper lakes, they may retreat to cooler, deeper water during hot summer months.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rivers and Streams</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Found in slow-moving stretches, backwaters, and oxbows with minimal current.</li>
        <li>Favor areas with overhanging banks, fallen trees, or root systems for cover.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reservoirs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Thrive in man-made reservoirs, especially where creek arms, coves, and submerged structures exist.</li>
        <li>Fluctuating water levels affect behavior, often pushing them into protected, shallow bays during spawning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Temperature and Water Quality</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimal temperatures: 65°F to 85°F (18°C to 29°C).</li>
        <li>Prefer moderately clear to slightly murky water; avoid extremely turbid or polluted environments.</li>
        <li>Require adequate dissolved oxygen levels and a healthy prey population.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Identification -->
    <section>
      <h2>Identification</h2>
      <p>Identifying a largemouth bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) is relatively easy thanks to several distinctive features:</p>

      <h3>Mouth</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Very large; upper jaw extends past the rear edge of the eye when closed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Body Shape and Size</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Elongated and robust body with slight side-to-side compression.</li>
        <li>Adults typically range from 12–20 inches (30–50 cm), but can exceed 10 pounds (4.5 kg).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Coloration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Greenish to olive back, fading to whitish or pale yellow belly.</li>
        <li>Distinct dark, horizontal stripe runs from gills to tail.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Fins</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Two dorsal fins: one spiny and one soft-rayed, connected by a shallow notch.</li>
        <li>Tail fin is slightly forked or rounded.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scales and Texture</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Covered with small, rough (ctenoid) scales.</li>
        <li>Skin feels rough when rubbed from tail to head.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Eye Color</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Typically dark or reddish-brown, especially in older or more aggressive fish.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Comparison Tip</h3>
      <p>Don’t confuse largemouth bass with these similar species:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smallmouth Bass:</strong> Smaller mouth, jaw doesn't extend past the eye, more bronze coloration.</li>
        <li><strong>Spotted Bass:</strong> Smaller mouth and blotchy side markings instead of a solid stripe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sport Bass Fishing</h2>
      <p>Sport bass fishing, especially targeting the largemouth bass, is one of the most popular recreational angling activities in North America. It blends strategy, skill, and passion.</p>

      <h3>Why It's Popular</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aggressive strikes:</strong> Known for hard hits and acrobatic fights.</li>

        <li><strong>Catch-and-release culture:</strong> Helps preserve populations and sustainability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Techniques and Tactics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lure Fishing:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Crankbaits:</strong> Mimic baitfish; good for covering water.</li>
            <li><strong>Soft plastics:</strong> Great for subtle presentations.</li>
            <li><strong>Spinnerbaits:</strong> Flashy and noisy; ideal for murky water.</li>
            <li><strong>Topwater lures:</strong> Create surface strikes; visually exciting.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>When to Fish</h3>
      <ul>
